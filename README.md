This is a challenge made by Nimble Gravity

## Deploy steps

- Clone this repo
- Install the deps with your prefered package manager. Ex:

```bash
pnpm i
```

or

```bash
npm install
```

- Copy the template.env to a .env file and fill the variable
- Run the project with the equivalent to your package manager.

```bash
pnpm dev
```

or

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building

- You can also build this project. It is configured for Static Site Generation and for Server Side Generation.
- For both you may run:

```bash
pnpm build
```
or
```bash
npm run build
```

- With this you will be presented with the built files in the dist folder on the repo root. The client folder inside it has the files for Static Site Generation, while the server site has the files for the Server Site Generation.
